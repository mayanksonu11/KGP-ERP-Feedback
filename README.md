# KGP-ERP-Feedback
In this project I have tried to implement a naive way to give feedback at the end of the semester. As it takes lots of time and most of the people are hardly interested in genuine feedback. So for those who are willing to save time during exam preparation may look into this.

# What this tool can do?
As I said its a naive tool it can just help you to fill up the form once you take it to the particular teachers window.

# How to use it?
Use is little bit difficult but not that much! Right click on the screen and open the inspect section of your web-browser.
Inspect one of the radio button to see what's its id, you don't need to write it down!!
Switch to console which is right next to your Elements tab (in the inspect window) and paste the relevant (Lab/Theory) code.
